4. Add a quick reflection(2 sentences) about what was difficult __Trying to find out how to get an image for the cookie instead of just a ball was difficult. I had to watch a YouTube video, but ultimately, a peer found out how. Also, trying to get the clicker count to show up on different screens was hard, so I manipulated the background image dimensions to do so.__
